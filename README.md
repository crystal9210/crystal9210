## I'm on my way for the best I can be.

## about

I first touched a PC in 2022 and have been primarily self-taught since then.

I have spent about 12-40 hours each day.

I promised myself in the past that I would never give up due to lack of ability when I need to someday, and that's my guideline to the present day and will be for the future.

That's it.
