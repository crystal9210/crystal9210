## I'm on my way for the best I can be.

## about

I first touched a PC in 2022 and have been primarily self-taught since then.

I have spent about 12-40 hours each day.

I promised myself in the past that I would never give up due to lack of ability when I need to someday, and that will be my guideline for the future.

The content includes general theory and implementation of the fundamentals of AI models, general practice of the fundamentals of software development in general, such as algorithms and design tradeoffs, exhaustive practices and use cases of security threat modeling and defense construction, and learning and practicing cryptography theory; and Various OSI layer theories and protocol designs and actual forms of service, etc.

I don't know what all this knowledge will be useful for, and there is always room for improvement, but I hope it will one day serve as a means to bring happiness to the world.

There are still many things I don't know and can't do, but I will continue to learn each time, and I will do what I can to respect and not disrespect my colleagues and the people around me.　(Based on past reflections)
